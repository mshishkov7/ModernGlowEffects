Bartender4 - Modern Glow Effects is a small, focused addon designed to modernize the visual feedback of the popular action bar addon, Bartender4.

If you love the customizability of Bartender4 but miss the clean, modern glow of the Retail World of Warcraft default UI, this addon is for you. It seamlessly replaces the older, default glow textures with the new, high-fidelity visual effects.

Install Bartender4 - Modern Glow Effects via the CurseForge App or by downloading the ZIP and extracting it to your Addons folder.
This addon is an extension and visual modification of the main Bartender4 project.
